## Puropse of this repo

This repository is inspired by the book "Grokking algorithms. An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people" by Aditya Y. Bhargava.
I implemented algorithms that are mentioned in this book to refresh some of the knowledge and also learn something new. Maybe I should not implement these algorithms in JavaScript, but it should not matter that much, ideas are the most important.

There are also unit tests. If you want to run algorithms with different data, change inputs and check if the output is correct.

## Tests

In the _tests_ folder you can find unit tests for every algorithm/function I implemented.

To run tests, at first install _jest_. In main folder:

```
npm install
```

And then use:

```
npm test
```

You should see test results and coverage in the console. Also, the _coverage_ folder is created.

## Implemented algorithms

I do not want to describe every algorithm precisely here. You can check the book or search for more info on the Internet. I have written quick overviews and some tips for my implementations.

### Binary search

It divides array in half and check if search value is higher or lower than the value of the element in the middle. Works only for SORTED arrays.

Implemented two versions of binary search:

-   recursive - _binarySearch.js_
-   using loops - _binarySearchRecursive.js_

### Quicksort

Quicksort is an example of divide and conquer algorithm. It divides problem to smaller pieces (in this example array is divided in half in every iteraion) and then easier problem is being solved.

In my repo I implemented using recursion.

### Breadth first search (BFS)

Breadth-first search is used to calculate the shortest path for an UNWEIGHTED graph. It also checks if there is possible way from start node to finish node.

_This implementation returns true if it can find the way from start to finish node_

### Dijkstra

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a WIGHTED graph. Algorithm works only when all the weights are positive.

My implementation returns an array with a path. Example:

```
['start', 'b', 'a', 'end']
```

You can read this as path:

```
start --> b --> a --> end
```

Right now it only show the path, but I will update it so it will also return a single value of the shortest path.

### Set covering problem

Set covering problem is NP-hard problem, so there is not an algorithm that will solve completely it in reasonable time. That is why we use greedy algorithm, that solves it well enough. It looks for optimal solution at every step, but it does not return optimal solution for the whole problem. Greedy algorithms are usually pretty simple and fast.

### Longest common substring and longest common subsequence

This two similar problems can be solved by using dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is based on idea of solving subproblems first and then the main problem. Tip: think about grid!

Longest common substring returns the common substring. It can be easly changed to return length of common substring.

Longest common subsequence returns length of common subsequence, because it would have to focus more on return value than on the algorithm and it is not a main idea of this repo.

### Recurisve functions

In _recursive_functions_ folder you can find some functions written using recrusion. These are not always algorithms, but only functions to refresh some ideas while using recursion.

Written functions:

-   biggestNumber.js
-   sum.js
